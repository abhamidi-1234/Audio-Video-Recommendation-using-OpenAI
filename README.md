# Audio-Video-Recommendation-using-OpenAI

## Introduction

Audio streaming services are becoming increasingly popular, and the ability to recommend songs and podcasts to users based on their listening history is becoming increasingly important. However, the abundance of audio content can overwhelm users, so creating an audio recommendation system can help users discover new and relevant content they will enjoy.

This audio recommendation system uses Python, OpenAI Whisper and Pinecone Vector Database.
